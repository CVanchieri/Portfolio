For the last 10+ years I have been working in project management and customer relations roles based out of the United States, I am now looking to transition to a company that is located here in Sydney.

My wife was born and raised in Sydney which grants me full working rights with a Partner Visa #0729500048650.

With a strong background in management, leadership, and customer relations, I am seeking an opportunity where I can apply my valuable skills and unique work experience. I am confident that I can excel in project management and leadership roles while also providing additional contributions to the company’s ongoing success.

Throughout my experience as a project leader I’ve been able to effectively manage teams of various sizes ranging from 45 to 5.  I have the ability to efficiently complete complex product releases all within budget and on time. My experience with strategically developing project plans, managing resources, and coordinating in-person and remote teams has prepared me to successfully manage new challenging projects in fast-paced environments.

In addition to project management, I have many years of experience with customer relations.  I have developed the skills that build and maintain strong productive relationships, help resolve customer conflicts, and ensure a higher retention through enhancing the customer experience. I understand the importance of in-depth product knowledge, listening to the customers, strategically resolving issues, and tailoring solutions to their unique needs to foster valuable long-term success.

My sales experience has also equipped me with expansive knowledge of CRMs, pipelines, various communication techniques, and the ability to correctly identify customer needs. I have great pride in my abilities to provide unique solutions, customer care that exceeds expectations, and a track record of exceeding sales targets and KPIs.

Furthermore, I am highly skilled in various technical tools and platforms, including Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, Asana, Jira, Trello, Notion, Monday, SaaS, Salesforce, Zendesk, Hubspot, GitHub, Figma, Python, SQL, HTML, and the Blockchain. I use these tools to enhance the operations of customer success, streamline project management, and to better understand technical developments.  My strong interest in self education and new technologies has always made it easy for me to adapt, pivot, and quickly learn anything new.
