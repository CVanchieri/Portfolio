![ProfilePic](/assets/images/General/aboutme.jpg)

I am a passionate Data Scientist in search of a company where I will have opportunity for career growth as well as growth in education and knowledge.  I am eager to join team where I am able to use my software engineering and data science skills to assist in exploring data, making predictions, and discovering data-based soltions while learning from the others around me.

 For the past 13 years I have been working in the health & wellness industry both corporate and privately in many different deparments.  Health & wellness and working with people was always natural and second-nature for me, so with a few great opportunities that is where I began my professional career in 2008.  I have always had a passion for technology and a desire to get involved with software engineering & developement but with no education in computer science I had little success finding any opportunities that were not sales. In early 2019 I decided I was going to pursue a career change and get involved with software engineering & data science by enrolling in Lambda School's part-time data science program.  Since June 2019 I have been taking online daily courses that covered the most important and commonly used computer science, software engineering, and data science techniques.  

Besides the constant indepth education what I really felt was important and useful were the group labs projects that were completed throughout the course.  The teams for these projects included multiple members from Web Fontend & Backend, UX & UI Design, and Data Science.  Having to work together through different platforms like Notion, Trello, GitHub, and AWS was great first hand experience of how a data scientist would work within a companies team from the concept of an idea to its final delpoyment.  I enjoyed and learned a lot from all the group projects I worked on but the **PlanetData.Vsion** website I was the most impressed with and probably my favorite to work on.  

The website is the start to an educational platform for middle school students to learn about some of Earth's environmental topics through interactive data visualizations.  Along with the rest of the team in generating ideas, I was able to produce 4 data visualizations for the project that were used on the site and assisted in the data science backend development that fed our collected data to the web development team.
